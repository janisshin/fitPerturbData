# Rosenbrock function benchmark
This is a benchmark test for this genetic algorithm. 

It uses a linear pathway and the algorithm is supposed to make k2 and k3 converge at values of 1.0.
The values of k1 and k4 do not matter. 

To run this test, first move runGenAlgo_banana.py out of the banana folder (into the larger genAlgo folder) and then run runGenAlgo_banana.py.
